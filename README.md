# nitro-programming-language

nitro is a programming language that programmed with c++ , Flex , Bison and uses LLVM compile system.
and uses optimization for fast compile.

### syntax 

nitro syntax is familiar to python syntax
, heres an example of a simple program in nitro :

```
word = "nitro"

for i in range(len(word)):
  print(i)
```

### how it works?

nitro uses Flex/Bison for tokenising and parsing and uses LLVM for compiling

### features

- fast compile
- better data management (variables , classes , objects)
- easy and fun to learn

### development 

remember that **this programming is in development and its not ready yet!** 

- create lexer ✅
- create parser ⬛
- create AST ⬛
- create compiler ⬛
